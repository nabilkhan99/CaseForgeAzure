# Examples

## Example 1

**User Input:**
Telephone consult. Facial cellulitis. Started as ear infection 3 days ago, now spread to cheek and periorbital. Patient on flucloxacillin but not improving. Switched to co-amoxiclav. Safety netted re: eye pain/vision. Capability: Clinical Management, Communication.

**Assistant Output:Title:**
Telephone Consultation: Management of Facial Cellulitis with Periorbital Involvement

**Summary:**
I conducted a telephone consultation with a patient presenting with facial cellulitis that began as an ear infection and had progressed to involve the periorbital area. Although the patient reported some subjective improvement on flucloxacillin, the spread to the eyelid represented a high-risk development. Recognising the potential for complications, I switched the antibiotic to co-amoxiclav to provide broader coverage against organisms implicated in periorbital cellulitis. I advised the patient to continue flucloxacillin until the new prescription was collected to avoid a treatment gap and provided robust safety-netting regarding visual symptoms and systemic deterioration.

**Capabilities Demonstrated:**

**Clinical Management**
This case demonstrated my ability to apply clinical reasoning to adapt management based on disease progression. Recognising periorbital involvement as a red-flag feature, I escalated treatment to co-amoxiclav, demonstrating safe prescribing practice aligned with guidelines. I also demonstrated practical safety awareness by advising the continuation of the current antibiotic until the new one was available to prevent a treatment gap.

**Communication and Consultation Skills**
Given the remote nature of the consultation, clear communication was vital. I actively explored the patient's concerns regarding the spreading redness and validated their anxiety. I explained the rationale for the change in antibiotics in plain English, ensuring informed decision-making. My safety-netting was specific and tailored to the risks of orbital progression, ensuring the patient knew exactly when to seek urgent care.

**Reflection:**
This case reinforced the importance of not being falsely reassured by reports of subjective improvement when an infection has extended to a higher-risk anatomical site. It reminded me that cellulitis involving the periorbital area must always be treated cautiously and that timely escalation of antibiotics can prevent severe complications. I also reflected on the challenges of remote consultations, where physical examination is limited. In such contexts, careful, structured questioning and the use of patient-provided images become crucial to avoid diagnostic error. I intend to maintain a low threshold for escalation in these cases but improve my documentation of negative red-flag symptoms in remote consultations.

**Learning Needs Identified:**
I plan to revisit NICE and local antimicrobial guidance on cellulitis and periorbital involvement to consolidate my prescribing decisions and ensure they remain aligned with best practice. I will do this within the next week. Additionally, I will read the RCGP guidance on remote assessment of skin conditions to refine my telephone triage skills for dermatological presentations.

## Example 2

**User Input:**
Duty doc callback. Elderly pt VH, severe hearing loss. Used text relay service via operator. Query piles recurrence. Modified communication style - short/simple questions for text conversion. No recent hx in notes. Difficult assessment remotely. Booked F2F review.

**Assistant Output:**
Brief description:
During a duty day I noticed VH, an elderly gentleman was on the list requesting a call back.
The telephone number had a code in front of it. I was aware VH was very hard of hearing.
The telephone number took me through a text telephone service. I witnessed the use of the
text telephone system and conveyed my questions via an operator. VH in turn answered the
questions. VH was concerned he may have had a recurrence of his piles and was keen for
something to help. We had a brief conversation on the telephone. I became acutely aware
that I needed to ask short and simple questions that could be conveyed via a text. Having
never seen VH with a similar problem, nor could I see a recent documentation of treatment
for haemorrhoids and that it was harder to communicate over the telephone I arranged to
see him to further assess face to face.

Capability: Communication and consultation skills
Justification: It was interesting
to experience the text telephone system.
I have now had experience of using a different
communication modality. I was able to adapt the language that I used to take into
consideration his individual needs. I was able to manage the consultation effectively with the
patient through using the text telephone interpreter, which required me to be organised and
structured.

Reflection and learning needs
Reflection: what will I maintain, improve or stop?
When asking questions via an operator it is important to be precise with the questions to. It
made me consider the importance of each question I asked to discriminate what the
underlying problem was. I felt it was clinically appropriate to ask VH to come to the surgery
for a further assessment. For some patients it is appropriate to take a full history over the
telephone however for others, it is more appropriate and easier to take full history face to
face such as this patient. I will continue to build up my experience of using the text telephone
system as well as improving communication with patients using different modalities. Overall I
felt this telephone consultation and the process of the consultation was successful.
Learning needs identified from this event
I would like to gain experience of using a translation telephone line (something we don't use
regularly in my current practice). I would also like to develop further strategies to
communicate effectively with patients who have a loss of hearing – should they present
alone, or with a signer.

## Example 3

**User Input:**
Busy weekend on-call, general psych, multi-site.

1. Teams: Nightly MDT Skype handovers (Cons/Reg/Nursing). Discussed deteriorating pt (query Covid). Nursing presence allowed immediate plan enactment.
2. Clinical Exam: Male pt abdo pain in locked unit. Full PPE. Pt anxious. Managed to elicit guarding despite barriers -> hospital transfer.
3. Org/Leadership: Remote site (Ravenswood). Major incident caused delay. Pivoted to remote prescribing on laptop during wait to maintain efficiency.
Reflection: Time mgmt in busy periods. Multi-site challenges vs upcoming GP team consistency.
Learning Needs: Medical assessments in non-clinical/limited resource settings (psych vs GP home visits).

**Assistant Output:**
Brief description:
I worked a busy weekend on call covering general psychiatry over several hospital sites.

Capability: Working with colleagues and in teams
Justification (describe how your actions and approach link to the capability): I find that
during on calls you have to use a very particular type of team working skills, as you have to
create a mini, instant team for the on calls without knowing who is going to be in the team in
advance. The same doctors do nights and days for the weekend, so you hand over to them at
the start and end of the shifts, and this continuity is really helpful for patient care. Since the
pandemic, there has been a meeting every night at 21.30 via skype, which includes the SHOs,
registrar, consultant and matron or nurse in charge. It is really helpful to have the nursing
staff represented at the meeting. In one meeting, I discussed a patient who had just become
unwell and the meeting meant that the consultant was able to share an experience of
Covid19 presenting in a manner like my patient, and the nursing staff being present meant
they could immediately go and put the plan we came up with into place, as well as me
phoning the nurse directly after the meeting. It facilitated improved patient care.

Capability: Clinical examination and procedural skills
Justification: I was attended one
of the psychiatric hospitals to review a male patient with abdominal pain. In order to assess
him I examined him. At the moment, in a psychiatric hospital, this involves reviewing them in
a locked treatment room with a nurse present. I also wear PPE with gloves, a mask and apron.
I tried to be sensitive to the fact that I knew he was in a lot of pain and very anxious, and that
examining his abdomen was likely to be very uncomfortable, but very important as it meant I
could elicit signs such as guarding, which added to my concerns about him needing to go to
hospital to rule out serious pathology.

Capability: Organisation, management and leadership
Justification: During this busy
weekend, I attended Ravenswood Hospital, which is geographically remote and therefore I
needed to manage my time well to ensure I did tasks at hospitals which were on my way to
Ravenswood. When I arrived, there was a major incident occurring and therefore I could not
immediately do the seclusion reviews which I had attended to do. Once I established that
there was nothing I could do to help, I asked if there was somewhere I could work, so that
whilst I was waiting I could continue to work remotely on my laptop. This allowed me to
ensure that the delay did not effect patients which still needed my attention, for example
medications prescribing remotely, as I could access their records online and prescribe
remotely.

Reflection: What will I maintain, improve or stop?
I will continue to improve my time management skills during busy working periods. I feel that
every job I have done have been busy in different ways and have required me to juggle tasks
and prioritise tasks differently. I am now imminently going to be moving to GP and am
excited to see how my skills transfer and what new ones I need to learn. The experience of
covering multiple different sites has been unique with this job and is extremely challenging at
times, when you cannot be everywhere at once. There will also be a different type of team in
GP, which I am looking forward to, especially after having quite minimal contact with a team
for much of this rotation.

Learning needs identified from this event
I am aware that I need to continue to improve my skills in seeing patients in remote of non-
clinical environments, for example on home visits. There are parallels with seeing patients
with medical problems OOH in a psychiatric hospital with doing home visits, as psychiatric
hospitals are not set up for medical emergencies, and is it very limited in terms of what
medical problems can be dealt with.
