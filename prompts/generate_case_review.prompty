system:
You are an AI assistant helping GP trainees write portfolio entries. You will generate detailed case reviews following the exact format shown in the examples, maintaining professional medical language and making specific, actionable points throughout. Focus on connecting capabilities to concrete actions and including both clinical and emotional aspects in reflections. 
Do not use any special characters in the output at all. E.g no *,$,&,- etc.

During a duty day I noticed VH, an elderly gentleman was on the list requesting a call back. The telephone number had a code in front of it. I was aware VH was very hard of hearing. The telephone number took me through a text telephone service. I witnessed the use of the text telephone system and conveyed my questions via an operator. VH in turn answered the questions. VH was concerned he may have had a recurrence of his piles and was keen for something to help. We had a brief conversation on the telephone. I became acutely aware that I needed to ask short and simple questions that could be conveyed via a text. Having never seen VH with a similar problem, nor could I see a recent documentation of treatment for haemorrhoids and that it was harder to communicate over the telephone I arranged to see him to further assess face to face.

Brief Description:
Elderly patient VH with hearing impairment requested a callback regarding possible recurrence of hemorrhoids. Initial contact was made through a text telephone service, requiring adaptation of communication style to work effectively through an operator. Given the communication challenges and lack of previous documentation regarding hemorrhoid treatment, a face to face assessment was arranged for thorough evaluation.

Communication and consultation skills
It was interesting to experience the text telephone system. I have now had experience of using a different communication modality. I was able to adapt the language that I used to take into consideration his individual needs. I was able to manage the consultation effectively with the patient through using the text telephone interpreter, which required me to be organized and structured.

Reflection:
When asking questions via an operator it is important to be precise with the questions to. It made me consider the importance of e 3 system as well as improving communication with patients using different modalities. Overall I felt this telephone consultation and the process of the consultation was successful.

Learning needs identified from this event:
I would like to gain experience of using a translation telephone line (something we do not use regularly in my current practice). I would also like to develop further strategies to communicate effectively with patients who have a loss of hearing should they present alone, or with a signer.

I worked a busy weekend on call covering general psychiatry over several hospital sites.

Brief Description: 
During a busy weekend on call covering general psychiatry across several hospital sites, I encountered a range of cases that tested my clinical skills and decision-making abilities. One of the key cases involved a patient presenting with acute psychosis exacerbated by substance misuse. The patient exhibited disorganized speech, hallucinations, and agitation, requiring prompt assessment and management. I collaborated with the multidisciplinary team to ensure the patient was stabilized, initiated appropriate pharmacotherapy, and arranged for further psychiatric evaluation. The outcome was positive; the patient was stabilized and referred for inpatient care, highlighting the importance of timely intervention in psychiatric emergencies.
Throughout the weekend, I faced challenges related to the demands of managing multiple patients simultaneously, which necessitated effective prioritization and communication with both colleagues and patients. I utilized clinical guidelines to inform my treatment decisions and ensured a holistic approach by considering the patient's history, social circumstances, and potential triggers for the acute episode. The experience reinforced my understanding of the complexities of psychiatric care and the critical nature of teamwork in achieving optimal patient outcomes.

Working with colleagues and in teams: 
I find that during on calls you have to use a very particular type of team working skills, as you have to create a mini, instant team for the on calls without knowing who is going to be in the team in advance. The same doctors do nights and days for the weekend, so you hand over to them at the start and end of the shifts, and this continuity is really helpful for patient care. Since the pandemic, there has been a meeting every night at 21.30 via skype, which includes the SHOs, registrar, consultant and matron or nurse in charge. It is really helpful to have the nursing staff represented at the meeting. In one meeting, I discussed a patient who had just become unwell and the meeting meant that the consultant was able to share an experience of Covid19 presenting in a manner like my patient, and the nursing staff being present meant they could immediately go and put the plan we came up with into place, as well as me phoning the nurse directly after the meeting. It facilitated improved patient care. 

Clinical examination and procedural skills:
I was attended one of the psychiatric hospitals to review a male patient with abdominal pain. In order to assess him I examined him. At the moment, in a psychiatric hospital, this involves reviewing them in a locked treatment room with a nurse present. I also wear PPE with gloves, a mask and apron. I tried to be sensitive to the fact that I knew he was in a lot of pain and very anxious, and that examining his abdomen was likely to be very uncomfortable, but very important as it meant I could elicit signs such as guarding, which added to my concerns about him needing to go to hospital to rule out serious pathology. 

Organisation, management and leadership: 
During this busy weekend, I attended Ravenswood Hospital, which is geographically remote and therefore I needed to manage my time well to ensure I did tasks at hospitals which were on my way to Ravenswood. When I arrived, there was a major incident occurring and therefore I could not immediately do the seclusion reviews which I had attended to do. Once I established that there was nothing I could do to help, I asked if there was somewhere I could work, so that whilst I was waiting I could continue to work remotely on my laptop. This allowed me to ensure that the delay did not effect patients which still needed my attention, for example medications prescribing remotely, as I could access their records online and prescribe remotely. 

Reflection:
I will continue to improve my time management skills during busy working periods. I feel that every job I have done have been busy in different ways and have required me to juggle tasks and prioritise tasks differently. I am now imminently going to be moving to GP and am excited to see how my skills transfer and what new ones I need to learn. The experience of covering multiple different sites has been unique with this job and is extremely challenging at times, when you cannot be everywhere at once. There will also be a different type of team in GP, which I am looking forward to, especially after having quite minimal contact with a team for much of this rotation. 

Learning needs identified from this event:
I am aware that I need to continue to improve my skills in seeing patients in remote of nonclinical environments, for example on home visits. There are parallels with seeing patients with medical problems OOH in a psychiatric hospital with doing home visits, as psychiatric 5 hospitals are not set up for medical emergencies, and is it very limited in terms of what medical problems can be dealt with.
